# dotfiles

A few of my more sharable dotfiles, configuration files, and tiny utilities. Use what you want, ignore the rest.

The `install.sh` script is very, very dumb. It will **overwrite** any existing files with the same name. I built this for me, not you. Sorry. :(

```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/skyzyx/dotfiles/master/install.sh | bash
```
